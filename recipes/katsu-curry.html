        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Katsu Curry</strong> is a beloved Japanese dish that combines the crispy texture of breaded and deep-fried cutlets with the rich, savory flavors of Japanese curry. Typically made with pork (tonkatsu) or chicken (chicken katsu), the cutlet is coated in panko breadcrumbs, fried to golden perfection, and served alongside a thick, mildly spiced curry sauce. The curry itself is made from a roux-based blend of curry powder, onions, carrots, and potatoes, resulting in a smooth and slightly sweet sauce that complements the crunchy cutlet. This dish is often served with steamed white rice and garnished with fukujinzuke (Japanese pickled vegetables) for a touch of acidity.</p>
        <p>A favorite in Japanese households and restaurants, <strong>Katsu Curry</strong> is a fusion of Japanese and Western influences, blending the European-style breaded cutlet with the distinctly Japanese take on curry. Unlike the spicier Indian varieties, Japanese curry has a more balanced, umami-rich taste with a velvety texture, making it accessible to a wide range of palates. The contrast between the crispy katsu and the thick, flavorful sauce creates a satisfying combination that has made Katsu Curry a comfort food staple in Japan and beyond.</p>
