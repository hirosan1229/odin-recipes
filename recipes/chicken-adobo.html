        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Chicken Adobo</strong> is a classic Filipino dish known for its rich, savory, and slightly tangy flavor. It is made by braising chicken in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns, creating a deep, umami-rich sauce. The slow simmering process allows the chicken to absorb the bold flavors, resulting in tender, juicy meat with a beautifully caramelized exterior. Some variations include adding sugar for a touch of sweetness or coconut milk for a creamy twist, but the traditional balance of salty, sour, and slightly spicy elements remains at the heart of this beloved dish.</p>
        <p>This dish is a staple in Filipino households and is often enjoyed with steamed white rice, which soaks up the flavorful sauce. Its simplicity and use of pantry staples make it a go-to comfort food that is easy to prepare yet incredibly satisfying. The longer it sits, the better the flavors meld, making it a great dish for leftovers. <strong>Chicken Adobo</strong>’s versatility has made it a favorite not just in the Philippines but around the world, as it continues to be a symbol of Filipino culinary heritage.</p>
