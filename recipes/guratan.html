        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Guratan (グラタン)</strong> is a Japanese-style gratin, a creamy, cheesy baked dish inspired by French cuisine. The dish typically consists of a béchamel sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, combined with ingredients like macaroni, seafood (such as shrimp or scallops), chicken, or vegetables like mushrooms and onions. This mixture is then transferred to a baking dish, topped with a generous layer of cheese—usually a blend of mozzarella, cheddar, or Parmesan—and baked until golden brown and bubbling. The result is a rich and comforting dish with a crispy, cheesy crust that contrasts with the creamy filling.</p>
        <p>While <strong>Guratan</strong> shares similarities with Western gratins and casseroles, its flavors are often adapted to Japanese tastes. Some variations include adding miso or soy sauce for extra umami or using panko breadcrumbs for a crunchy topping. It is commonly served as a main dish alongside a simple salad or bread. Popular in home cooking and found in cafés and family restaurants across Japan, guratan is a beloved comfort food, especially during the colder months.</p>
